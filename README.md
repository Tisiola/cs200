CS200 final project
The Research - An adventure game made with Twine :)
Tisiola Patterson
The interactive game will tell the tale of the open-source movement.
The game will also explore the concepts of whether everything should be open-source or not.
The user is a student who is doing research for their final on the open-source movement.
The user will have the option to either goof off or put on music in the background/get to work. Putting on music will lead to working or goofing off.
Choosing to goof off will result in nightmares and will lead back to the original 2 days.
Should the user choose to do work, there will be Google searches and YouTube searches relating to the open-source movement and different links to explore that give information.
